## Introduction

This repository serves as a training module for the Queen's Startup Consulting Technical Team. The lessons are designed to provide a solid foundation in both frontend and backend development, with additional modules on databasing, authentication, and AI. Each section includes hands-on exercises and projects to reinforce learning.

## Frontend Development

### HTML and CSS

Before diving into more advanced topics, we start with a refresher on the basics of web development:

- **HTML:** Learn the structure of web pages, elements, attributes, and how to create a semantic layout.
- **CSS:** Understand how to style web pages using CSS, including selectors, properties, and responsive design techniques.

### React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This module covers:

- Introduction to React
- Component-based architecture
- State and props
- Lifecycle methods
- Hooks
- Handling events and forms

### Next.js and Tailwind

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. This module covers:

- Setting up a Next.js project
- Routing and navigation
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- Integrating Tailwind CSS for styling
- Advanced features and optimizations

## Backend Development

Backend is the server-side of a web application. It handles the business logic, database interactions, authentication, and authorization, etc. 

### Express.js

Express.js is a backend framework designed for building web applications and APIs using Node.js and JavaScript.

- Handles HTTP requests
- Routing
  - Creating HTTP endpoints to be accessed
- Middleware
  - Processes results from databases

### APIs

A set of rules and protocols that allow different software to communicate with each other. This is in the form of definitions of methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. This allows for frontend to receive and present data that is calculated in the backend. 

### Postman

Tool: A popular API testing tool that helps developers test, develop, and document APIs.

## Databasing

There are two different types of databases: 

**SQL** (Relational Databases): Organizes 
- data into tables with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, Oracle Database, and SQLite.
  
**NoSQL** (Non-Relational Databases): 
- Handles data not fitting into tables. Examples include MongoDB and Firebase.

### MongoDB

This repo covers using MongoDB as it provides scalability, performance, and flexibility. 

## Authentication

## AI Integration
